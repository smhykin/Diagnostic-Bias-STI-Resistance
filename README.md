# Diagnostic Bias & STI Resistance: A Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to a three-part portfolio exploring how diagnostic methods, gender-based detection differences, and treatment strategy shape the trajectory of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and antimicrobial resistance.

Each project combines epidemiological modeling, public health theory, and data science to spotlight underexplored vulnerabilities in STI detection and treatment.

## Projects

### 1. Treat the Partner, Save the Population
ðŸ“‚ [`mgen_partner_prophylaxis/`](./mgen_partner_prophylaxis)

A compartmental model simulating *Mycoplasma genitalium* resistance spread under three care strategies: standard treatment, reactive partner treatment, and prophylactic partner treatment. Results support preemptive treatment as a resistance control strategy.

- Skills: simulation modeling, scenario analysis, resistance dynamics
- Deliverables: Jupyter notebook, visualizations, brief report

---

### 2. The Hidden Curve: Seroconversion Lag in Female Syphilis Cases
ðŸ“‚ [`syphilis_seroconversion_lag/`](./syphilis_seroconversion_lag)

Time-series modeling of syphilis case detection by sex, incorporating seroconversion lag to investigate underdetection in women. Hypothesis: delayed immune response and anatomical differences skew surveillance data.

- Skills: lag modeling, surveillance bias analysis
- Deliverables: Jupyter notebook, sex-stratified analysis, brief policy memo

### 3. The Microscope as a Time Machine: Modeling Early Detection via Wet Mount Microscopy
ðŸ“‚ [`syphilis_microscopy_intervention/`](./syphilis_microscopy_intervention)

Simulates the effect of wet mount microscopy use in early-stage syphilis detection among women, particularly in reproductive health contexts. Explores transmission reduction, faster treatment, and secondary resistance impacts.

- Skills: diagnostic modeling, intervention simulation, public health scenario testing
- Deliverables: detection curve model, outcomes comparison, visual storytelling
