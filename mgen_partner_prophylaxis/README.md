# Treat the Partner, Save the Population

**Modeling the Impact of Prophylactic Partner Treatment on M. genitalium Transmission and Antibiotic Resistance**

This project simulates how different partner treatment strategies affect the spread and resistance dynamics of *Mycoplasma genitalium* (MG), a rising STI known for rapid antibiotic resistance. We compare:

1. Standard care (index case only)
2. Reactive partner treatment
3. Prophylactic partner treatment (before sex with a new partner)

## Key Findings (TBD)
- Prophylactic treatment significantly reduces transmission, reinfection, and resistant strain emergence.
- Resistance rates above 30% dramatically increase the value of pre-contact treatment.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Compartmental modeling (SIR variant)
- Simulation of biological and behavioral factors
- Scenario testing with policy relevance
- Visualization and interpretability
