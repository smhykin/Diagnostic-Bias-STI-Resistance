# The Microscope as a Time Machine

**Modeling the Benefits of Wet Mount Microscopy in Early Syphilis Detection**

Could a return to simple microscopy in gynecologic care catch more syphilis cases early—and prevent resistant cases down the line? This project models:

- Baseline detection timelines using current protocols
- Alternate timelines using wet mount microscopy (esp. in vaginal discharge–presenting cases)
- Effects on transmission and resistance evolution

## Motivation
Women often go undiagnosed in early syphilis due to vague symptoms and delayed seroconversion. Microscopy is fast, cheap, and underused—could it help close the diagnostic gap?

## Skills Demonstrated
- Diagnostic pathway modeling
- Scenario testing with health system implications
- Visualization of intervention timelines
- Translational public health framing

- `/figures/` – visual timelines and comparative outcomes
- `/report/` – illustrated brief for public health audiences
