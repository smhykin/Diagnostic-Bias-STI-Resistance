**Modeling Sex-Based Seroconversion Lag in Syphilis Surveillance**

This project investigates whether reported sex disparities in syphilis incidence may be partially explained by seroconversion delays in women. Using time-series modeling, we simulate:

- Delayed antibody development in female infections
- Differences in detection timing and test sensitivity
- How current surveillance methods might undercount early-stage female cases

## Key Questions
- Is the observed male-to-female syphilis ratio exaggerated by diagnostic lag?
- How much earlier would female cases be detected if serological lag were reduced?

## Skills Demonstrated
- Epidemiological inference
- Lag-time modeling and simulation
- Data stratification by sex and timeline
- Policy-aware analysis
